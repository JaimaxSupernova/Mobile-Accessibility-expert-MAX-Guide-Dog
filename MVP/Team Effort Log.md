# Team Effort Log

## Ane Jensen
### Sprint 1(week 2 & 3)
* Familiarizing with GitLab and GitLab structure, and brainstorming the concept of the project. The link to the Jira story can be followed by clicking [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-19).

### Sprint 2(week 5 & 6)
* Looked into different design solutions for the stair problem and determined if it is realistic to assume we can solve this problem in the given circumstances. Jira link found [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-10).

### Sprint 3(week 7 & 9)
* Solved the "sensor returning only 0" problem, where the sensors' output to the serial monitor remained 0. Link for this story found [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-56). 
* Started working on connecting multiple sensors to the Raspberry Pi Pico. Link for the second story found [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-54).
* Working on the Project Management part of the Minimum Viable Product and Technical Documentation.

## Jaimin Dave
### Sprint 1(week 2 & 3)
* Researching, experimenting, and testing MAX head rotation using a stepper motor and L298N module. Link to Jira story can be found [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-13).

### Sprint 2(week 5 & 6)
* Research on I2C and implementing the learned skills by using a display for testing purposes. Researched on the viability of stair climbing solutions. Link to this can be found [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-4).

### Sprint 3(week 7 & 9)
* Working on connecting multiple ultrasonic sensors to the Pico. Changed the approach to MAX head rotation by switching to a servo motor instead. Link for the story regarding ultrasonic sensors can be found [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-54).
* Working on the Team Effort Log part of the Minimum Viable Product and Technical Documentation and compiling a parts list for opening.
* learnt how to use git commands in terminal. Link can be found [here](https://cseegit.essex.ac.uk/23-24-ce201-col/23-24_CE201-col_team-18/-/commit/0e15d1fc6e33c0da5474c4b40b2e6598b04ffd36)  

## Lavanya Annathurai
### Sprint 1(week 2 & 3)
* Researching on creating an app for the visually impaired, noting down the necessary features and implementations. The link for this and the next 2 sprints can be found [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-6).

### Sprint 2(week 5 & 6)
* Connecting the app to MAX, looking into the use of a Bluetooth module.

### Sprint 3(week 7 & 9)
* Creating the GUI of the app, keeping in mind features previously researched. [Link shared](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-6) with Sprint 1 because this task is an added extension of recent tasks.
* Working on the Project Management part of the Minimum Viable Product and Technical Documentation.

## Marley Hayward
### Sprint 1(week 2 & 3)
* Researching, testing, and experimenting on getting the car moving. Links for each respective document of compiled research and testing can be found [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-11).

### Sprint 2(week 5 & 6)
* Research and implementation of I2C, PWM, and SPI by testing applications. Link for this can be found [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-22) and [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-45).

### Sprint 3(week 7 & 9)
* Completed getting valid input from ultrasonic sensors, started working on connecting multiple to the Pico by creating a test program which is linked [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-14).
* Working on requirements and risk assessment part of the Minimum Viable Product and Technical Documentation and compiling a parts list for ordering.

## Shelton Darvin
### Sprint 1(week 2 & 3)
* Designing the basic model for MAX on CAD. Completed and uploaded a screenshot and design on Jira which can be found [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-24).

### Sprint 2(week 5 & 6)
* Designing the moving head of MAX. Completed and uploaded a screenshot on Jira. CAD design along with screenshots of the model can be found [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-25).

### Sprint 3(week 7 & 9)
* Working on the product demonstration part of the Minimum Viable Product and Technical Documentation.
* Compiled a list of parts needed for ordering and checked compatibility with the project. The Jira link for this can be found [here](https://cseejira.essex.ac.uk/browse/D201038-55).

## Thakshon Anantharaja
### Sprint 1(week 2 & 3)
