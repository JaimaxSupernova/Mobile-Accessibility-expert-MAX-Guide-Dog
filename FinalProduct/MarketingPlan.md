# MARKETING PLAN
Max is an innovative robotic system designed to help people with vision difficulties. It performs similar tasks as a guide dog, with a lot of features aimed at improving user safety and freedom. MAX is built to make use of today's advancements in technology.
Same as dolphins utilising echolocation, MAX's primary function is its capacity to use ultrasonic sensors to autonomously navigate and identify impediments in the customer's route. Vibrating sensors built into the handle, these sensors allow MAX to warn its owner so they may direct clear of any dangers and navigate safely.Users can utilise voice commands to specify destinations with the navigation system, and it makes real-time changes based on signals from the surrounding environment.The city instructions supplied by MAX which guarantees safe travel in crowded metropolitan environments and inside out navigation for simple navigation via public buildings are the notable characteristics.

## Customers

A major advancement in assistive technology is portrayed by Max , is intended to help the visually impaired. Due to its specific characteristics which include an emergency stop function communication, a handle resembling a dog leash, and various navigation sensors, it is positioned as a highly specialised tool for improving safety and mobility for those with vision impairments.

### Primary Customers 
Max is mostly used by those who are visually impaired. This covers individuals who are totally blind as well as those who have partial vision, for whom finding their way about in strange places can be quite difficult. The World Health Organisation estimates that at least 2.2 billion individuals worldwide suffer from short or long sightedness. Max is a robotic replacement for conventional guide dogs that is hypoallergenic and does not provide the same health concerns or emotional distress for people who are allergic to animals or who just dislike them. Additionally, it offers a culturally aware solution that supports people's religious convictions that exclude engagement with specific animals while still fulfilling their mobility demands.
The substantial expenses linked to obtaining and caring for a guide dog may be unaffordable for most people suffering from visual impairment. By providing an affordable one time investment option that avoids recurring costs for animal care and training, Max removes these financial obstacles.

## Economics

### Total Market Cap
By analysing the number of cases of visual impairment and the adoption rates of assistive devices the overall market size for assistive technology for the visually impaired may be approximated. At least 2.2 billion individuals worldwide suffer from blindness or visual impairments, of which about 1 billion have untreated or preventable conditions as stated by the World Health Organisation (WHO). From basic canes to advanced technological gadgets like Max, the market for assistive technology for the blind offers a wide range of items. Due to technology developments and growing awareness of the requirements of visually impaired people, this industry which was previously estimated at several billion dollars, is likely to rise greatly.

### The percentage of the market share.
 Max has the potential to take up a sizable but limited share of the market because of its distinctive positioning as a robotic guide dog with advanced characteristics not often seen in conventional assistance devices. Targeting early adopters and tech lovers within the community of visually impaired people, the first market penetration may be small. Aiming for a 1-5% market share in the initial years might be a reasonable target, with room for expansion as the product gains traction and becomes more widely available.Due to the ageing of the world population and rising prevalence of diseases like diabetes that can impair vision, there is now a significant and expanding need in the target market for assistive equipment for the visually impaired. Innovative solutions that can improve the freedom, safety and quality of life for people with visual impairments are always needed. There is a specific desire for products that offer new features enhance user experiences, and blend effortlessly into everyday life. Max meets these requirements with its simple appearance and advanced navigation capabilities, indicating a positive market response.

### Target Market Trends
Solutions are growing more and more technologically advanced as elements like artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning, and sensor technology emerge. More autonomy and improved navigation in different contexts are highly desired features in devices.
Combining assistive technology with smartphones and smart home appliances is a huge trend that is helping people live more connected and comfortable lives.
Enhancing the User Experience and Personalisation are becoming increasingly important. Customisable devices are gaining popularity since they cater to the unique requirements and preferences of the user.

## Competition
* White canes: The traditional stick normally used by the blind. They are easy to use, lightweight, and affordable. White canes are the most popular navigational aid. Although they give tactile sensation, they don't give much  specific information about what is the obstacle.

* Trained guide dogs: These provide intelligent navigational help and companionship. However due to allergies, space constraints, or personal preferences, they are not ideal for all users and need a large time and money investment in training and maintenance.

* Wearable technology:  OrCam MyEye records visual information and produces audio explanations of it. Whenever something is meant to be read it is read and audio explaination is given by thr device to the user. Then the Sunu Band is a device that uses sonar to identify obstructions and it alerts the user.However these are kind of expensive gadject comparing to its usages.

* Smart Canes: Items such as the WeWALK smart cane use ultrasonic sensors to identify obstructions and link to smartphones to offer GPS guidance. They are still constrained by the cane form factor but they are a step forward in smart mobility aids. The are recommended to be used on non-commercial places.

### Advantages of Max over the above devices

* Improved User Experience:
Robotic Guide Dog Form Factor: Max offers a more natural user experience by replicating the shape and capabilities of a guide dog. For people who are used to use guide dogs this design may adjust while providing a low maintenance and allergy free alternative.
Max's handle, which looks like a conventional dog leash  has a vibrating feedback feature that gives users rapid tactile input. This makes it simpler for users to understand and interpret warnings and advice than voice messages.

* Flexibility and Self reliance:
Indoor and Outdoor Navigation: Max's ultrasonic sensors allow for efficient navigation in both indoor and outdoor enviornment, providing users with more flexibility and independence than GPS based devices that are only meant for use outdoors.

* Emergency Stop Function: This safety function boosts user confidence by allowing for an instant stop in potentially dangerous circumstances which is not typical in most electronic mobility devices.
Cost and Accessibility

* Lower Total Cost of Ownership: Max's initial cost may be more than certain technological equipment it may have a lower total cost of ownership than a guide dog taking into account the expenditures associated with care, training, and maintenance during a dog's lifespan.

## Sales forecast and cash flow analysis.
Assuming a targeted marketing strategy and a strong market response, an initial sales prediction might range from 500 to 1,000 units in the first year. This projection takes into account the specific market, the product's premium cost, and the time required to increase consumer recognition and trust.


Cash Flow
With a median price of £3,000 per unit

For 500 units: 500 times £3,000 = £1,500,000.
For 1,000 units: 1000 times £3,000= £3,000,000.


### Best Guess
Monthly sales are expected to gradually climb as awareness develops, with spikes during large marketing campaigns or industry events.Overall in the end of year we aim to sell 1,000 units taking into account manufacturing increase and market acceptance rates.

### Worst Case 
Monthly sales are expected to develop slowly because of probable market share issues or production delays.
If the cases are unfavourable in the end of year cautious assumption of 500 units sold ensures that even under difficult market conditions the baseline targets are attainable.
